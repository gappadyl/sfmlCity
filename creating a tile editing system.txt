Problems and things that need to be solved to edit map.

General
-need to find a way to spawn entities consistenly in the map on construction
{on runtime can look at map and find default tile to spawn too or throw error when it doesn't exist}

-need to have a default map if the current map is too small{camera is too squishy}
{we could write a file for default and check if the cameras size is within a comftorable margin and then run default
instead if the loaded file is clunky and throw an error message}

-need to change camera and entity bounds to visible terrain
{we can have the entity be bounded by the max size of the map,
we can have the camera be bounded by a Rectangle shape that can be stretched to fit a larger box than the terrain 
or default to the terrain size 
we can have the editable tiles have a hitbox so entities can't travel on them and are constricted to walkable terrain


Editing
-The editing bounds will be constricted by the max width and height of the map thats constructed
//when in Game mode you will be limited to what we want visible, in Editing it will open up to the max bounded area set

-in editing mode we want to render out squares out of bounds as textured like "+" or something else 
and in game mode we want to render out water or someother tile. 
{needs it's own function for level edit rendering- }
-want to be able to pick up entities and place new ones without them getting stuck in bounded areas
{need to check if a tile is has hit box is true.
-want to place tiles upon entities while not blocking them and not trapping them.
{we can have a hover of the tile type being rendered underneith the entity

-do not want holes in map-> check if tile is contained in visible space and delete it if not. 

-it would be very nice to be able to drag and expand the visible space.
{maybe look at having a rectangle shape be used for visible space. ->if the height and width are larger than 
the visible land keep it or if it is shorter then default to land length. maybe could have red on tiles that are not 
visible, delete them if save? 
 
need to come up with a editing GUI and use it to keep track of current tile selected, what tiles clicking, deleting.
ECT... what functions do we need in level and how are we going to structure in GUI
